    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Kefei Duan, who is an undergraduate student at Peking University and will graduate in 2023. I'm interested in natural language processing, natural language understanding, question answering system, knowledge extraction, human-computer interaction, etc. I would like to pursue a PhD degree in related area after I graduate from Peking University. </br>From my perspective, my interests for these things mainly come from my enthusiasm for computer and robot. It's so exciting to have machines understand human language and knowledge, to communicate and interact with a computer, and to see what knowledge computers can gain from text and language. In my opinion, true artificial intelligence should be intelligence that can understand human language and can gain knowledge from it. This can take a long time to achieve and require many people to put in their efforts.</p>

            <li>
              <p>Main Contributions: In this project, my main contributions are doing some preliminary research to find potential direction, conducting some pre-experiments to test our idea and help us determine the focus and direction, implementing all the baselines to compare with our method and processing some data for our use.</p>

            <li>
              <p>Main Contributions: I lead the project to do some preliminary research to figure out whether our idea has been proposed and implemented before, initiate the idea and implement our algorithm, implement all the baselines to compare with our method, do experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our model and write the paper for the submission purpose.</p>

            <li>
              <p>Current Progress: For now, we have done some preliminary research and conducted some experiments using some baselines. We have implemented a simple model based on our idea, but more things need to be done. Due to time constraints, this project was temporarily put on hold. We will start working on this project again afterwards and it will become my thesis topic.</p>
